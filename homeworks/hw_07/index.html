          back, which stores nutrients. Since the bulb can photosynthesize,
          Bulbasaur can go days without eating. As with the rest of its
          evolutionary line, its bulb has vines the Pokémon uses as tentacles.

          them in battle. It attacks by spewing fire from its mouth, swinging
          its tail around, or clawing away. Its fire turns bluish-white when it
          is excited..

          Smash Bros. Ultimate as a part of the "Pokémon Trainer" fighter, and
          one of Kanto's starter Pokémon.[16] After it hatches, its back
          gradually swells and hardens into a shell. It withdraws into its shell
          for protection or to sleep, and its grooved, rounded shape reduce its
          water resistance, allowing it to swim faster. To attack, it sprays
          foamy water from its mouth.

          #0039. It is a playable character in every Super Smash Bros. game. It
          can inflate itself like a balloon to float around and it can sing. Its
          voice's wavelength can match the brain waves of sleeping people and
          Pokémon, lulling them to sleep. If the foe does not fall asleep, it
          can risk its life by singing until it runs out of air. It also keeps
          singing if the foe does fall asleep.

          brain cells activate, causing it to accidentally unleash psychic
          energy. It then forgets that it used those powers.

        <p>
          #0079. Slowpoke is dumb and lazy, to the point of taking up to five
          seconds to process pain. It lives on the edges of bodies of water and
          uses its tail to fish for prey, but may take a day to notice that its
          tail has already been bitten off. Some cultures believe its yawns
          bring rain, and worship it. It evolves into Slowbro when a Shellder
          bites its tail, or into Slowking when it bites its head. It has a
          Psychic-type Galarian form.

          #0133. Eevee is often considered among the "cutest" Pokémon in the
          franchise.[94][95][96][97] Due to this, Eevee is featured on various
          Pokémon-related merchandise.[98][99][100] It is the mascot of Pokémon:
          Let's Go, Eevee! Eevee has exclusive evolution styles, where each
          evolution requires special requirements to occur, resulting in 8
          different Pokémon. Eevee and its evolutions are sometimes referred to
          as "Eeveelutions". Eevee is mostly found in highly populated areas
          like cities and towns. Its unstable genes allow it to adapt to most
          habitats, and even to its trainer, to the point of eventually adopting
          a face similar to theirs. In generation VIII, it gained a Gigantamax
          form.

        <p>
          #0150. It is a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Melee, Super
          Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.
          Mewtwo originated from the DNA of Mew, mutated by Dr. Fuji in a lab
          after years of gene splicing. Even though it has powerful psychic
          abilities, scientists failed to give it a compassionate heart, and it
          turned vicious as a result. It rests to conserve energy, so that it
          can unleash its full power in battle. In generation VI, it gained two
          Mega Evolutions; one adapted for physical attacks, and one adapted for
          special attacks.

          #0151. This mythical Pokémon is so rare, only a few experts worldwide
          have found it, though a growing number of people have reportedly seen
          it recently. It apparently originates from South America. It is said
          that it appears only to those who have a true heart and a strong
          passion to see it. Its DNA is said to contain the genetic code of
          every Pokémon and every move. Because of this, many scientists believe
          that it is the ancestor of all Pokémon. Its fine, small, and delicate
          hairs can be viewed with a microscope. It is capable of turning
          invisible at will so that people are unaware of its presence. It is
          considered one of the original progenitor Pokémon, as all Pokémon are
          said to have descended from Mew.
